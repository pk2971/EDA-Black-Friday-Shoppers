# EDA-Black-Friday-Shoppers
EDA project on Black Friday Shoppers to understand the customers.

Data set taken from Kaggle, uploaded in the repository.


In this project we analyze the data taken from a Black Friday Sale.

We would like to find out about the shopping habits of customers across Gender, Occupation and other factors. 

We want to visualize how the customers are spending and cluster them into groups so we can group them into categories for better understanding of the data.
